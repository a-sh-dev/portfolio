# ✨ Personal Portfolio

```
 → version 1.0
```



This project is the second personal portfolio built since I've begun my coding journey. A revamped of the first one that I built by only using HTML5 and SASS. <sub> [Check the GitHub repo for the first project.](https://github.com/a-sh-dev/T1A2_Portfolio)</sub>

After completing the boot camp, I initially planned to use only `React.js`, but I'm sold by how `Next.js` features a faster and more scalable app due to its server-side rendering capability. `Next.js` is an extension framework of the `React.js` library plus the added SEO friendliness and built-in router improvements. Generally, it's faster due to its server-side rendering functionality, especially for generating static websites.

The most enjoyable learning in this project is building reusable components and working on conditional rendering through data iterations. All the UI styling are only made possible (and faster) thanks to `twin.macro`, which significantly assists in blending the best of two worlds between `Tailwind CSS` and `Styled-Components`. 

By no means this portfolio is entirely complete. There are many rooms for improvements. But I'm happy to release this version while at the same time working for further development and refinement.

### 🛠  Known Issues

- FIXED. <s>Due to an unknown problem, I'm currently fixing the `SendGrid` integrated contact form. I tried testing the form submission to the `Next.js` endpoints, yet despite the 200 status delivery reports, I never received any emails in the mailbox. 🥲</s>
- I tried to animate the heights of the collapsible component on the about me section (on the home page). Yet, it has resulted in weird unwanted extra spacing to the remaining content. I may use a third-party package to help with this additional interactivity.
