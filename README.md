# Personal Portfolio

```
version 1.0
```

This is the second personal portfolio built since I've began my coding journey. The first one was built only using `HTML5` and `Sass`. [Go to the GitHub repo.](https://github.com/a-sh-dev/T1A2_Portfolio)

 I fell in love with `Next.js`, a `React.js` framework that is meant to improve sites built with `React`, particularly the SEO improvements and the built-in router. 

I spent so much time working on the typography, layout and content. This is the first project where I utilise `Tailwind CSS`, through the help of `Twin.macro` as a bridge to merge or combine the best of two worlds between `Tailwind CSS` and `Styled Components`. 

By no means this is completely complete. There are so many improvements to be made!
