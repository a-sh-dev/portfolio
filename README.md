# ✨ Personal Portfolio

```
version 1.0
```



This project is the second personal portfolio built since I've begun my coding journey. I built the first one only by using `HTML5` and `SASS`. <sub> [Check the GitHub repo for the first project.](https://github.com/a-sh-dev/T1A2_Portfolio)</sub>

I originally planned to create the portfolio only by using React.js after I completed the boot camp. But I fell in love with `Next.js`! It is a framework and extension of the `React.js` library with massive SEO capability and built-in router improvements. Generally, it's faster due to its server-side rendering functionality.  

I enjoy building reusable components and working on conditional rendering. All the UI styling are only made possible (and faster) with the help of `twin.macro`, which significantly assists in blending the best of two worlds between Tailwind CSS and Styled-Components.

By no means this portfolio is entirely complete. There are many rooms for improvements. But here I am applying the agile methodology and deploying this version – that I think is presentable despite its imperfectness and known issues.

### 🛠  Known Issues

- Currently working on fixing the contact form with SendGrid integration due to an unknown issue. I tried testing all the API form-post. The report received 200 status on the delivery post, yet I never received any emails in the mailbox. 
- I tried to animate the heights of the collapsible component on the about me section (on the home page). Yet, it has resulted in weird unwanted extra spacing to the remaining content. I may use a third party to help with this additional interactivity.



### 🌝  Personal Reflections

I didn't expect the overall development to consume a lot of time! However, I sweat on the content and styling, and I am very proud of what I've done so far! 

As a first-timer using `Tailwind CSS`, I genuinely recommend it! It makes styling faster and is highly customisable. I learned a lot more about flexbox and grid layout in this project (as often it drives me insane!). At the moment, the responsive design uses a lot of manual tweaking for each breakpoint (which I'm not happy about). Perhaps spending more time configuring the design system and typography would save more time and effort in the responsive UI styling for future projects, for example, figuring out the resposnive font sizes, margins and paddings etc... <sub>Yes, these things (really) matter to designers 🤣.</sub>
