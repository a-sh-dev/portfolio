# Personal Portfolio

```
version 1.0
```



This project is the second personal portfolio built since I've begun my coding journey. I built the first one only by using `HTML5` and `SASS`. <sub> [Check the GitHub repo for the first project.](https://github.com/a-sh-dev/T1A2_Portfolio)</sub>

I originally planned to create the portfolio only by using React.js after I completed the boot camp. But I fell in love with `Next.js`! It is a framework and extension of the `React.js` library with massive SEO capability and built-in router improvements. Generally, it's faster due to its server-side rendering functionality.  

I enjoy building reusable components and working on conditional rendering. All the UI styling are only made possible (and faster) with the help of `twin.macro`, which significantly assists in blending the best of two worlds between Tailwind CSS and Styled-Components.

By no means this portfolio is entirely complete. There are many rooms for improvements. But here I am applying the agile methodology and deploying this version ‚Äì that I think is presentable despite its imperfectness and known issues.

### Known Issues

- Currently working on fixing the contact form with SendGrid integration due to an unknown issue. I tried testing all the API form-post. The report received 200 status on the delivery post, yet I never received any emails in the mailbox. 



### Personal Reflections

I didn't expect the overall development to consume a lot of time! As the first Tailwind CSS project, I truly recommend it! It makes things faster and highly more customisable. I learn a lot more about flexbox and grid layout. At the moment, the responsive design uses a lot of manual tweaking for each breakpoint. Perhaps spending more time configuring the design system would save more time and effort in the responsive UI styling, for example, figuring out the margins and paddings etc. <sub>Yes, these things (really) matter to designers ü§£.</sub>
