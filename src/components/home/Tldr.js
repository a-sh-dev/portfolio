          Learning to code was meant to expand my skillsets as a graphic
          designer.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, surprisingly, the coding passion has grown so much that I want to
          pursue this career, not as a graphic designer who can code but as a
          developer who understands visual design communication. Furthermore, I
          hope to gain professional experience beyond web development and, one
          day, be able to make a difference in the tech world for humanity!
          (...and not be intimidated by robots! ðŸ¤–).
