Since then, I have revamped the personal portfolio with Next.js (a.k.a, this website you're currently viewing). Initially planned to use only React.js, but I'm sold by how Next.js can make React.js faster and scalable due to its server-side rendering capability. Plus, with the added SEO friendliness! Obviously, the portfolio has much room for improvement and is still under development. However, I learned a lot from the styling implementation. All thanks to Twin.macro, which combines the best of two worlds of Styled-components and Tailwind CSS.",
